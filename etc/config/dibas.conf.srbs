# 3-6, etc.), or a combination of both (1, 2, 5-8).  Too many values,
# duplicate values, or values greater than 8 or less than 1 will

# datahost        : The 10Gbs IP address for the roach

# dest_ip         : The 10Gbs HPC IP address
# dest_port       : The 10Gbs HPC port
# katcp_ip        : The KATCP host, on the 1Gbs network
# katcp_port      : The KATCP port on the 1Gbs network
# synth           : 'local' if Valon is attached to HPC, 'katcp' if onboard the roach PPC
# synth_port      : The Valon synthesizer serial port
# synth_ref       : Valon frequency reference, 'internal' or 'external'
# synth_ref_freq  : Valon reference frequency
# synth_vco_range : Valon VCO range
# synth_rf_level  : The RF output level, in dBm. Legal values are -4, -1, 2, and 5
# synth_options   : Valon options. With the exception of the reference frequency multiplier,
#                   all of these are flags which either are clear (0) or set (1)

# filter_bandwidth_bits:
#                   These are the input filters. They are low-pass. The
#                   values are arranged as bw, bits, bw, bits, bw,
#                   bits. The SHAO and Green Bank devices differ in
#                   filter values, hence this entry.

# Optional:
#
#    shmkeys      : A key of keys. The comma-separated list will be interpreted as keys to
#                   kv pairs in this section, which themselves will be read and placed in
#                   the status shared memory. In the following example, 'FOO':'cat',
#                   'BAR':'frog' and 'BAZ':'dog' will be placed in shared memory. If 'shmkeys'
#                   is missing, or has an empty list, or if any of the keys listed by 'shmkeys'
#                   is missing, no kv pairs will be loaded into shared status memory:
#
#                   shmkeys = foo,bar,baz
#                   foo = cat
#                   bar = frog
#                   baz = dog
