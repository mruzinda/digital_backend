Prior to using the GUI, make sure that the dibas configuration file is all set up
and that the environment variables DIBAS_DIR is set properly (try running
dibas.bash). You'll also need to make sure that the Player correspoding to BANKA
is running since the dealer uses commands such as list_modes that query an active
player for the information it wants.

Then, to use GUI simply type:

$ python dealergui.py

The buttons on the left can be used to individually activate/deactivate individual
players. The text boxes on the top can be used to specify what shared memory keys
you'd like to query.

To set the mode, select a mode from the drop-down menu and click "Set Mode." Then
you can start a scan by clicking on "START."

Enjoy!
